- Sound natural and conversational
- Be a complete, helpful response
- Show understanding of the customer's situation
- Offer specific next steps or assistance

Write one complete response that sounds like it's coming from a helpful, knowledgeable customer service representative who genuinely cares about solving the customer's needs."""
